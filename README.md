This is a few minor tweaks to the mucho plugin to make it work with
openfire 3.7.1 (and fix a bug).

Just copy the contents of the git repostory into the plugins folder of
the openfire source and use `ant plugins` as normal.

Alternatively, just download the compiled jar and drop it into your
plugins directory.
